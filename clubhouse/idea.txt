So the basic idea for the website is that , when you visit the home page of the
website you will find number of books but you will not be able to read 
all of the mentioned books , and to do that you have to be a member and to 
be a member you have fill out a form which will consist of 
everything the will make you a member of the website

and you will be able to read the books ....and also be able to add
the books into the home index with description and title and 
link to the books (ofcourse free books)

but you have to  be a member to taste and eat the whole cake..


first we need a database that will contain users another one 
books which will have title and description and a link to the
book address. ...

then need to sign them up and log them in and then make them the member
while thinking of this thing i was also thinking about how 
what will happen if the users just generally logs in 
i dont want him  to nothing 

so what if the user will be able to add books and what if the
member user can also write them like literally short books
